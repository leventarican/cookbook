Java is a conservative language.

# Streams
* since Java 8; before interfaces used only for API specification without any implementation.
* are wrapper around the data source
* do bulk operations on the data source in concise way

# Java Syntax
* __operators__ group tokens intro larger expressions
* __statements__ group of expressions and other statements
* __methods__ named collections of statements
* __classes__ collection of methods and fields
* __packages__ collection of related classes

# Memory Management
* the memory occupied by an object is automatically reclaimed when the object is no longer needed.
* this process is done by the _garbage collection_

# Pass by reference
* java is a pass-by-reference language; not a pass by value lang.
* values are not directly passed in methods; instead the reference.

# Design
* use SOLID principles to avoid bad design
